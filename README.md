# lab06-sockets

## Overview
The internet wasn't built to be very dynamic, and historically web pages were just static HTML with links, creating a conceptual web of information. These were done by stateless requests and RESTful API's, but as time went on, static webpages gave way to dynamic content which doesn't work stateless. The internet needed a way to maintain bi-directional, persistant connections between client and server.

## Objectives
* To learn what WebSockets are
* To learn how to network with node.js
* To set up a simple messaging application with a client-server architecture
* Practice the observer model

## Necessary Files
You will need to **fork** and **clone** [this repository](https://github.com/info498e-w17/lab06-sockets) and open the folder in your favorite editor.

## WebSockets
So what are these websocket things anyways?
WebSockets are a bi-directional, full-duplex, persistant connection between a client (web browser) and server. Now, a client can request a socket connection with a server, and it stays open until either party decides to close the connection. With an open socket connection, clients or servers can send data to eachother at any time. This solves the problem of event-driven web programming! Facebook notifications? websockets.

## Networking in node
There are a few different javascript implementations of websockets, like [ÂµWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets), [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) (probably the fastest) or [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io), but we will be learning the basics with the standard node api network wrapper.

### Net Module
The net module provides you with an asynchronous network wrapper and allows you to create clients and servers.
Import the net module with `import net = require('net')`

### Node Event Emmiters
Node.js is built around the idea of an asynchronous, event driven architecture where certain types of objects (called "emitters") emit events that cause functions called listeners to be called. Every object that is an instance of the node EventEmmiter class has a method called eventEmmiter.on(), this allows you to listen for specific events and respond accordingly.

#### Node .on()
In order to listen to events you can call .on() to a defined emitter object with parameters like `emitter.on(eventName, listener)` where eventName is a string, and listener is a callback function.

Additionally you can define and listen for custom emmiters like: (outside scope of this excersise)
```
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');

```
## Client-Server Architecture lab task
In lecture we talked about the client-Server architecture. Now you will practice implementing the client-server architecture with the observer pattern and sockets.
In this lab you will be building a simple client-server messaging platform (basically IRC).


## Node Servers
We will start with server.ts, locaed in /src in it you will find some starter code that lays out the basic outline of a node server.
A call to `net.createServer()`, returns a net Server object which is used to create a TCP or local server.

Hints

* You should maintain a list of client socket connections
* Write a broadcast(message:string) function which your server can use to send the same message to all of its client sockets
* When your server receives a message from a client, it should broadcast the same message

### Socket Connections
When a client connects to the server, it emmits a 'connection' Event which returns a reference to the socket of the connected client. In order to listen for it pass a a socket to an anonymous function
```
//notify (via observer!) when a a connection occurs
server.on('connection', function(socket) {

   //we've established a socket to use

   //send a message to the socket
   socket.write('Hello you!\n');

   //close the connection
   socket.end();

});
```

### Running The Server
In order to actually start the server, you need to call `server.listen(<port>)`, passing in a number of the port you want your server to run on.
This will emmit an event called 'listening', which you can also listen for (meta).

```                          
//when we start "listening" for connections
server.on('listening', function() {
   //get address info
   var addr = server.address();

   //print the info
   console.log('server listening on port %d', addr.port);
});

server.listen(3000); //listen on port 3000
```

### Recieving messages
When data is sent from a client to a server, it sends data to a socket. This is emmitted as a 'data' event on the socket in above anonymous function. You can do something with that data by calling `data.toString()`, which converts it to a readable string.
You can also write to a socket, with `socket.write()` which will emitt a 'data' event on the client end.
```
/* when a socket is connected... */

//notify on data received event
socket.on('data', function(data) {

   //process data
   var echo = data.toString().toUpperCase();

   if(echo === 'EXIT') {
      socket.write("Goodbye!");
      socket.end();
   }
   else {
      socket.write("Did you say '"+echo+"'?");
   }
});
```

## Node Clients

Your client code should take user input from the command line, and send it to the server.
It should also print out messages that it receives from the server to the command line.

The way to create clients in node is to initialize a new net.Socket() object, and to call connect() on the new socket object. The main events that need to be listened for are 'data' and 'close'.
```
//make the client
var client = new net.Socket();

client.on('data', function(data) { //when we get data
   console.log("Received: "+data); //output it
});

client.on('close', function() { //when connection closed
   console.log('Connection closed');
});


var HOST = '127.0.0.1';
var PORT = 3000;
//connect to the server
client.connect(PORT, HOST, function() {
   console.log('Connected to: ' + HOST + ':' + PORT);

   //send message to server
   client.write("Hello server, I'm the client!");
});
```

## Running your code

Run `tsc --watch` to set up typescript auto transpilation.

Run `npm run server` to run your server.

Run `npm run client` to run your client.

For development, run your own server on your machine. Your client will be another command line on the same machine.

Once your code is working, you can try to connect to the class server running on the TA's laptop (details on the board).
